DESCRIPTION
       emorom will list or extract files from a PlayStation 2 ROM image, or
       rebuild an image from loose files.

   Operation Mode
       The operations listed in the table below tell emorom what operation
       it is to perform. Exactly one of them must be given. The meaning of
       other arguments depends on the operation mode requested.

       -l     List all files found within a ROM image. The image must be
	      specified with the -i option.

       -x     Extract all files found within a ROM image. The image must be
	      specified with the -i option. A directory file, dir.txt, is
	      also created.

       -b [-vv] [-i dir.txt] [-o out.rom]
	      Build a ROM image from lose files. The options are:

	      -v, -vv
		     Verbosely build. With -v, emorom will give a short
		     summary after the image has been built. With -vv,
		     emorom will additionally list all files processed.

	      -i dir.txt
		     Specifies the directory file to use as a template for
		     the ROM image. If this option is not present, the
		     default value of dir.txt is used.

	      -o out.rom
		     Specifies the name of the output file. If this option
		     is not present, the default value of out.rom is used.

RETURN VALUE
       emorom's exit code indicates whether it was successfully able to
       perform the operation. 0 is returned for success. Nonzero is
       returned for failure.
