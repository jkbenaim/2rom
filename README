NAME
       2rom - a utility for working with PlayStation 2 ROM images

SYNOPSIS
       2rom -l -i in.rom
       2rom -x -i in.rom
       2rom -b [-vv] [-i dir.txt] [-o out.rom]

DESCRIPTION
       2rom  will list or extract files from a PlayStation 2 ROM image, or re-
       build an image from loose files.

   Operation Mode
       The operations listed in the table below tell 2rom what operation it is
       to perform. Exactly one of them must be given. The meaning of other ar-
       guments depends on the operation mode requested.

       -l     List all files found within a ROM image. The image must be spec-
              ified with the -i option.

       -x     Extract  all  files  found within a ROM image. The image must be
              specified with the -i option. A directory file, dir.txt, is also
              created.

       -b [-vv] [-i dir.txt] [-o out.rom]
              Build a ROM image from lose files. The options are:

              -v, -vv
                     Verbosely  build. With -v, 2rom will give a short summary
                     after the image has been built. With -vv, 2rom will addi-
                     tionally list all files processed.

              -i dir.txt
                     Specifies the directory file to use as a template for the
                     ROM image. If this option is  not  present,  the  default
                     value of dir.txt is used.

              -o out.rom
                     Specifies  the name of the output file. If this option is
                     not present, the default value of out.rom is used.

RETURN VALUE
       2rom's exit code indicates whether it was successfully able to  perform
       the operation. 0 is returned for success. Nonzero is returned for fail-
       ure.

BUGS
       2rom cannot build a big-endian image.
